# PPPUCpp_Exercises

This repository contains my personal exercise implementations from "Programming Principles and Practice Using C++" by Bjarne Stroustrup. It's a reflection of my journey learning C++ and exploring various programming concepts and techniques presented in the book.

## Disclaimer

I strongly encourage learners to try solving the book's exercises themselves before looking at my code. The true value lies in the process of problem-solving and critical thinking. Please use this repository as a reference only after you've attempted the exercises yourself. Also, while I strive for correctness, these implementations are my own and may not be perfect. I welcome constructive feedback and discussions!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- Basic knowledge of C++ and programming concepts

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Jeff-Meendering/PPPUCpp_Exercises.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory of the project.
3. the source file you want using your C++ compiler.
    ```sh

    ```
4. Run the compiled program.
    ```sh
    ./my_program
    ```

### Repository Structure

The repository is organized with directories for each chapter of the book, and the exercises are named based on their numbers in the book.
